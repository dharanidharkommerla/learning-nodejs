Browser
========
1. the javascript that runs on the Browser has the window object.
    from window object we can access methods like alert() ,..

2. document object is also available 

3. storages --> local storage, session storage --> offline storage 

4. browser has cookie

5. browser javascript doesn't support file system. to read, write, delete, rename, move, copy,..

6. No Database Interaction available

7. this javascript is used for the developing client applications / ui



NodeJS
=======
1. the javascript file that runs on the node has No window object available

2. No document object available

3. it doesn't support offline storage

4. nodejs don't have the cookie

5. nodejs has the file system

6. Database Interaction available

7. this nodejs is used for developing server app / backend

NodeJS
------
but frontend developers and backend developers both uses nodejs,

Frontend Development(applications developed using angular, react,...) 
--> NodeJS acts like Runtime Enviroment/server for the frontend application

Backend Development 
--> NodeJS acts like a programming language, 
--> it has a lot of modules(os,fs,http,url,crypto,...)

<pre>
    Here’s a clear and simple explanation of the tools you've listed, including **ExpressJS** and **NestJS**, in the same style:

---

### 🛠️ **create-react-app**

* **What it is:** A CLI tool provided by the React team.
* **Purpose:** Quickly sets up a **React** project with everything pre-configured (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.).
* **Use case:** Ideal for **single-page applications (SPA)** and learning React.
* **Command:**

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  ```

---

### ⚛️ **Next.js**

* **What it is:** A **React framework** built by Vercel.
* **Purpose:** Helps in building **server-side rendered (SSR)** and **static websites** using React.
* **Use case:** Great for production-ready apps with SEO, routing, and performance optimizations.
* **Features:** File-based routing, API routes, SSR, static generation, image optimization, etc.

---

### 🚂 **Express.js**

* **What it is:** A **backend web framework** for Node.js.
* **Purpose:** Simplifies creating REST APIs and web servers.
* **Use case:** Lightweight backend APIs or full-stack JavaScript apps with React or other frontends.
* **Code Example:**

  ```js
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));
  app.listen(3000);
  ```

---

### 🧱 **NestJS**

* **What it is:** A **TypeScript-based backend framework** built on top of Express (or optionally Fastify).
* **Purpose:** Offers a **structured, scalable**, and **enterprise-ready** way to build server-side apps.
* **Use case:** Large backend applications with modular architecture, decorators, and dependency injection (similar to Angular).
* **Code Style:**

  ```ts
  @Controller()
  export class AppController {
    @Get()
    getHello(): string {
      return 'Hello World!';
    }
  }
  ```

| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| create-react-app | React CLI Tool    | Create basic React SPAs                   | JavaScript    |

FullStack = FrontEnd + BackEnd + Database
            Frontend --> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, Angular/React/Vue/NextJS

            BackEnd --> NodeJS, ExpressJS / NestJS

            Database --> MongodDB, MySQL/Oracle/
